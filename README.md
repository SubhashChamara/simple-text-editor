# Simple Text Editor

## Welcome to My Text Editor Application Project !

During my training period at IJSE (Institute of Software Engineering) as a Training Fullstack Developer, I developed a user-friendly text editor application. The application allows users to open any text file on their computer, edit the content, save changes, save as a different file name, find and replace words, and even open files using a drag and drop feature. The goal of this application is to provide a simple and efficient tool for editing text files, enhancing the user's productivity and ease of use.

I developed this application with the specific intention of polishing my knowledge of Java SE file I/O operations and regular expressions. By implementing the file opening and saving functionality, I deepened my understanding of reading and writing files in Java. The find and replace feature allowed me to apply regular expressions for searching and manipulating text effectively.

As I look forward to expanding the application, I aim to enhance my skills and knowledge in the text editor. Your suggestions for future improvements are welcome as I strive to learn and grow in this project.
